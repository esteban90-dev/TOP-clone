# TOP clone

This is the second part of the [Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework) of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [HTML and CSS course.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/)
The Odin Project's landing page was cloned using this [CSS framework](https://github.com/esteban90-dev/css-framework).  The framework was only slightly tweaked to achieve this - two colors specific to The Odin Project's site were added, and one additional spacing value was added.
